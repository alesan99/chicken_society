	"priority": true, // Important Story Quest

	// You're investigation the snake again like in the beginning of the story
	// What has changed? Why weren't you able to get a solid lead last time?
	// Maybe the Mafia was conducting their own investigation and have more clues for you
	// That would explain why they were willing to let you, the lead suspect, join the Mafia
	// Update:
	// You have to capture Griswold using griswold's dynamite as bait, which the mafia discovered and kept.
	// The mafia asks you to capture him because they thought Bhurgert blew up their factory.
	// They didn't know about the snake skin you found, and they didn't know Bhurgert's
	// snake was capable of making bombs.
	// With this new found knowledge, you can now try to capture Griswold.
